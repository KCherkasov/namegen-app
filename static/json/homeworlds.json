These luxuries might be the finest pelts and grox meat of a feudal world, or the most potent of narcotics and offworld delights on a mainstay hive world. To be a highborn is also to enter into a world of deadly politics and ancient feuds, where children grow up with terrible enemies and sleep knowing there are those that would cut their throats for a taste of their hereditary position. Highborn often live their lives apart from the rest of their world, sometimes never leaving the high castles, spire cities, and sky palaces far above the swarming masses. They are content in the knowledge that they are the instruments of Imperial dominance on their world and the voice of the Emperor to their people, and anything that would disrupt such a state is unthinkable anathema."

On many of these worlds, gunpowder-based devices represent the extent of advancement. Ranks of crude blackpowder firearms and legions of mounted warriors on the charge might make for the ultimate weapons on their battlefields. The other defining aspect of feudal worlds is how their natives live, all part of networks of obligations and allegiances throughout a tribe or other societal grouping. These ties remain throughout generations, all members born, raised, and dying within their fixed stations. Like their technology, feudal worlders exist in a stagnated state. In many ways their society is similar to the Imperium itself, a welcome familiarity after the shock many natives of such worlds face as they become aware of the wider society of Mankind."

Some are even brought into life through deliberate machinations, the acts of those who keep the Left Hand of the Emperor ever watchful. Daemon worlds require investigation to seek the seeds of the Ruinous Powers’ evil harvest, so that it can be prevented elsewhere—for once a world has been steeped in the stuff of Chaos, it is never the same again. Regardless of their origins, these planets are twisted parodies of reality, where the improbable is often made manifest and corruption infuses the land. Those who live there are often reduced to amusing prey or tortured slaves for the Ruinous Powers, and survival is more than just staying alive—it is also a struggle to stay human."

These purgatories made real are often ruined worlds left forgotten due to their lack of strategic importance or natural resources. Buildings are repurposed and retrofitted to accommodate massive numbers of inmates, and automated defences are brought in to keep the new residents in line. It is here that the lawbreakers are left to wither and die—though some survive to escape their sentence, and fight for the Emperor on other fronts."

Whatever the catastrophe, potential or historical, it is viewed as a far greater risk than any reward it could bring. Once the edict is given, the Imperial Navy provides the military and defence systems the situation requires, from message buoys at the outskirts of the system to patrolling ships and orbiting weapons platforms. No unauthorised craft is allowed anywhere near the space and any found are generally destroyed without question. In case of extreme risk to the sector, the human population is often annihilated to prevent any potential escape attempts. Regardless of whether anyone survives this culling, no one is allowed to set foot on those planets without proper authorisation. To be discovered breaking a writ of quarantine is a death sentence."
