Without the Administratum, the Imperium would dissolve into madness and mayhem. It would be cut off not only from those hidden hands that guide its wealth and resources, but also from its history and the centuries of secrets kept deep within the data vaults of the Imperium’s largest organisation."

There they received the Light of the Emperor, filling them with terrible purpose to defy the tyrant who had taken control of the Ecclesiarchy and instigated the worst civil war since the Horus Heresy. When they emerged from that most holy chamber, they carried His righteous fire within them. Dominica descended upon the treacherous High Lord Vandire and ended his terrible Reign along with his life. In the Reformation that followed, the Decree Passive was enacted to forbid the Adeptus Ministorum from controlling any men under arms, and thus prevent the Ecclesiarchy from threatening the Adeptus Administratum’s rule over the Imperium. The all female Daughters were deemed exempt, though, and became the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas — a powerful presence to ensure the will of the Ecclesiarchy was enacted faithfully. The fierce devotion of the Sisters to their Emperor has ended many a threat from within the Imperium since those dark days. No heretic can stand against their zeal in enacting the judgement of the Ecclesiarchy, but the Sisters have also grown into a number of Non-Militant Orders devoted to the healing arts, communications, and diplomacy. In all ways, though, they are supremely loyal to the Emperor, utterly incorruptible and ready to purge all heresies with hymns and fire."

Possession by a Daemon is such a doom, perhaps the most terrible of any imagined. Though possession nearly always results in the death and eternal damnation of the mortal who is dominated by the Daemon, it is not always the case. Some few—perhaps fortunately, perhaps not—are freed from their torment as the Daemon is cast out of them, only to face lifetimes of horrors remembered from the experience. These rare mortals are constant reminders of the terrors that await Mankind should the Ordo Malleus fail and Chaos triumph."
