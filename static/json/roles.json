The Assassin is such a being, spending their lives perfecting talents in the kill, rising to greater heights with each life they take. While many who serve the Emperor are proficient in battle, Assassins revel only in the act of killing and often care little for commonplace combat. Driven with either an unhealthy thirst for the blood of others or a cold detachment leaving them bereft of their humanity, they can come in a variety of forms, linked together only by their desire to deliver death in the most efficient or grandiose way possible. They are inevitably drawn to those organisations which revere killing as much as they do or are in need of such artful killers. Many join death cults, societies devoted to the act of murder. Others might be recruited to mysterious Imperial organisations devoted to the art of sanctioned killing. In all cases it is the desire to take life and develop the skills of doing so which defines the Assassin, a journey which will end only when they themselves succumb to death."

They see the understanding of the blessed form of Man and other biologics as paramount to life, either to preserve it or control it, and can become obsessed with perfecting their understanding of such matters. Some may come from the ranks of the Adeptus Mechanicus Biologis, others serving as Imperial Guard medicae or Adepta Sororitas Sisters of the Orders Hospitaller. Some may have operated as unguilded hab-docs, feral shaman-healers, or personal medilords to spire rulers. Their abilities place them in a position of great power within the Imperium, gifted as they are with the talent to either heal or harm depending on their own whims and those of their lords. As such, a good Chirurgeon can always find a place as a torturer or excoriator, his ability to cause pain a vital commodity within the hierarchy of Imperial society. More than a talent for torture or a skill at mending mangled bodies, the Chirurgeon is defined by his thirst for knowledge and a drive for experimentation, often at the expense of his patients and their wellbeing. It is an obsessive drive that can lead to great discovery and triumph, but also to the creation of abominations which were never meant to be."

Those that survive long enough become adept at sensing danger, dealing with others of their kind and knowing well when to cut and run. They can also become talented gunslingers, frequently using their weapons to protect their lives or take the lives of those in their way. Desperados are defined by their selfish natures and scorn for authority, choosing the path of the outlaw if it means living free and getting a quick score to see them though another day."

Either as Primaris Psykers, primitive Warp-seers, or renegade sorcerers, Mystics represents Mankind’s connection to the Sea of Souls and the powers and denizens which dwell within. Their cursed gifts lead many of them to view all things as interconnected. Even the slightest occurrence can be seen as signs from beyond, and technology as an unreliable prop against the terrors unseen. To even glimpse what exists beyond the veil is to see the fragile nature of reality, and know of horrors no ordinary Imperial citizen can be allowed to see. The Immaterium and its use can offer a man salvation when he needs it most, a weapon to use against his enemies, or a glimpse of the future to guide his actions. However, like the ancient Terran sea of old, it is unpredictable, untameable, and can change in an instant. This is the peril that all Mystics must live with, the knowledge that for all the power their gifts might bring and the position it might grant them, eventually it will likely destroy them. Mystics are defined by their connection to the Warp, providing them with knowledge beyond that which man was meant to know, and of humanity’s only true defence against the terrible entities which hungrily wait across this gulf in reality."

They can see patterns that others cannot, making connections to either retrieve or uncover data considered lost or unattainable, and translating it into useful knowledge for those around them. It is a process that takes great mental strength and skill, and often the implanted aid of artificial cogitator arrays or logis circuits that provide swifter reasoning and retention of facts. Sages have the ability to access the thousands of years of sorted Imperial data to find missing secrets, or making leaps of logic to identify them when they remain elusive."

A Warrior has a talent for combat, and finds it his most effective means of resolving matters; chainsword and hand cannon are his most reliable forms of communication. He leaves a battle ragged but alive, his foes lying in pools of blood.

It consumes his life, and the depth of his conviction creates the purity of utter certainty in his actions and utter obsessiveness towards his goals. He might easily hate anyone not agreeing with him as much as he hates the target of his beliefs, and burn friend as well as foe in his quest. Death holds no fear, and any setbacks only make him redouble his efforts. Convinced in the righteousness of his beliefs, no matter what they are, he strides fearlessly against his foes as an unstoppable force, and woe unto anyone or anything that dares bar his way."

Even this mental suffering is not enough—for many, similar punishment of the flesh is also necessary. He might obsessively lacerate his own skin with a small whip he carries in one hand, or he — humble even in his suffering — might employ such devices as an inner waistcoat of tiny barbed chainmail or gloves lined with burning chems. The Penitent fully believes in his woeful state, and his sins dominate his thoughts. He might share them with others, but most keep such transgressions private. He knows he has erred in the eyes of the Emperor, and that is enough in his fervent desire for utter purity. The Penitent knows of his terrible sins, be they real or imagined, and devotes himself to using pain, denial, and other mortifications of the mind and body in his quest for redemption."

Each is a sacred artefact of the Machine God, imbued with a spirit and a purpose. Those who excel in the operation of vehicles must understand this. To obtain the best results from any vehicle, the operator must honour and placate its spirit, and always treat it with the due respect. The difference between a merely skilled driver and a true Ace is a nigh-preternatural ability to commune with the spirit of a vehicle, allowing it to almost predict his actions, rather than respond to them. Some say such an ability cannot be taught, but is a gift from the Omnissiah. Although there are many skilled pilots and drivers in the Imperium, Aces are those of singular aptitude, whose seemingly impossible feats of manoeuvring set them apart. Such skills are in high demand across the Imperium, from Lightning Strike Fighter pilots of the Imperial Navy, to Imperial Guardsmen racing their Leman Russ tanks into the heart of enemy forces, to bike-mounted gangers in the depths of hive cities, to noble feudal warriors mounted atop reptilian beasts barded in plate. What these disparate individuals have in common is a peerless affinity for operating vehicles, one which—quite understandably—often lends itself to an air of bravado."
